## Learning the code base informed my design decisions & considerations

<img width="70%" src="./images/typing.gif" />

---
export default Layout

<img width="60%" src="./images/dying.gif" />

When the team dislikes my designs

<img width="60%" src="./images/done.gif" />

When a developer changes the design
---
export default Layout

## I had to pause and reflect
---
export default Layout

Am I really **listening** to their feedback?
---
export default Layout

Am I involving them in the **design** process?
---
export default Layout

<img width="100%" src="./images/lightbulb.gif" />

I wasn't being **inclusive**
---
export default Layout

Started **whiteboarding** with engineers
---
export default Layout

Started **wireframing** with engineers
---
export default Layout

<img width="70%" src="./images/hands-on.gif" />

## When you do things together
---
export default Layout

Involving **developers** into the **design process** allows them to be part of the solution

Created a backlog
---
export default Layout

<img width="50%" src="./images/plan.png" />

Tracked design work in the master plan
---
export default Layout

Every UX item was tied to a **developer** (area owner)
---
export default Layout

<img width="70%" src="./images/explore.gif" />

## Still had the freedom to explore

## Speeds up the design process
---
export default Layout

<img width="70%" src="./images/typing.gif" />

## I had to pause and reflect
---
export default Layout

Am I really **listening** to their feedback?
---
export default Layout

Am I involving them in the **design** process?
---
export default Layout

<img width="100%" src="./images/lightbulb.gif" />

I wasn't being **inclusive**
---
export default Layout

Started **whiteboarding** with engineers
---
export default Layout

Started **wireframing** with engineers
---
export default Layout

Iterating on the feedback

**together** 

lead us to better & faster results
---
export default Layout

Involving **developers** into the **design process** allows them to be part of the solution

Little design impact

export default Layout

<img width="80%" src="./images/plan.gif" />

My work was not on the plan
---
export default Layout

**Weekly syncs** with the engineering manager
---
export default Layout

**Weekly UX syncs** with the team
---
export default Layout

<img width="52%" src="./images/backlog.png" />

Created a backlog
---
export default Layout

<img width="50%" src="./images/plan.png" />

Tracked design work in the master plan
---
export default Layout

Nearly every UX item was tied to an area owner (dev)
---

<img width="100%" src="./images/explore.gif" />

## Freedom to explore
---
export default Layout

<img width="100%" src="./images/think-about-it.gif" />

## Now it was on the plan
---
export default Layout

Team has **visibility** of design efforts
---
export default Layout

Community is able to give **feedback**
---
export default Layout

**Accountability** to follow through
---
export default Layout

<img src="./images/integrate.gif" />

## Getting involved

standups, sitdowns, demos, bug bashes, testing, lunch
---
export default Layout

You have a much **bigger impact** when you are **in sync** with your team
